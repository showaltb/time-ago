# time-ago

`<time-ago>` is a simple web component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev).

It takes a `seconds` attribute with a timestamp in epoch seconds, and displays
it as an HTML `<abbr>` element showing a "human-friendly" offset generated by
the [s-ago](https://www.npmjs.com/package/s-ago) package.

The element's `title` attribute will show the timestamp as a locale string in
the browser's time zone.
